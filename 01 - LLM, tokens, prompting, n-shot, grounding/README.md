# Kickstarting the Journey into Generative AI: Insights from the First Session

Welcome to the fascinating world of Generative AI, where the convergence of innovation and technology sets the stage for limitless possibilities. Our first session laid the groundwork for an exciting semester, diving into the basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Let’s explore the highlights!

## What is AI and ML?

Artificial Intelligence strives to mimic human intelligence, while Machine Learning focuses on systems that learn and improve from data. Here's how they interconnect:

- **AI**: Encompasses systems designed to replicate human-like behaviors.
- **ML**: A subset of AI, specializing in creating models that learn from data patterns.
