from us, so a lot of like military applications, like all this encryption and networking. So I don't know, it's technically possible that yeah, such technology can appear, but taking into account how much time and money and resources and smart people it takes to build such thing, so maybe the first country which builds it, I don't know, we'll create some kind of like snow crash like from cyberpunk books, I don't know. So we'll see. At least like, I know like from what I understand like IT history and technology history, like all the new like top tier technologies, they have like two applications, like the two industries basically driving them fast in like making them broadly available is porn industry and military. So this is like two things usually picking up the latest stash and trying to get like money of that and maybe one of them will pick it up, I don't know, maybe military first. So we're gonna see the new applications of quantum stuff. Yeah, but from personal perspective, like being a human, like, I don't know, like IT guy, so yeah, that's interesting, but unless I cannot benefit from that, I cannot, unless I cannot like earn money doing that, so it's inevitable for me, like the sun, the sun just can stop, I don't know, like, okay, bad example because the earth rotates across the sun, so the earth can just stop rotating and it will be an infinite night for me. So I can't do anything about that, I can't do anything about rain, so what I can do is just to buy the umbrella, I don't know, pray the rain stops sometimes, so in case I have the problem or something I cannot influence I think it's good not to worry about it because if you worry about something you cannot change, that's bad, so you spent a lot of resources and the result will be nothing, like for sure, so my plan is just read the news, I don't know, follow this agenda, but don't worry about it. Okay, yeah, let's get down to business. So let me try to open my, open our schedule. I have to reboot my PC today, so I lost this Excel spreadsheet. Okay, this one. Okay, so the good news, good news, we are on track, right? And here we are, meeting number five, so today we're gonna discuss Whisper API and local installation. The bad news, I took a look at some of the Chromeworks, two or three, maybe five, but not very high level. I like the blog posts you guys made, so I like the pictures and I think I will share some of my favorite pictures next time. So I assume I will need this weekend to check them and probably to, I don't know, set some marks or something like that, so just give me some time, but I haven't found any critical problems there, so just remember to share the workflow, how you did that, like for the first task, so I need to see like what prompts you've been using and don't forget about the pictures, so the pictures are necessary for our blog post. So I think we're gonna focus on that, probably either on this lecture or this one, we don't have time to review the Chromeworks, but today we're gonna discuss the Whisper API and this is very, let me show the slides, so here are the slides for today. So what is the Whisper and why are we discussing that? So mostly when people discuss the generative AI or AI in general, so they focused on like LLMs, I don't know, like compilers, functions and stuff like that, so everything that works with text, right, because it has more application to the business when you work with text, but still usually what is being forgotten is images and audio processing, and regarding the images, I can't say this like easier to monetize this, so not too much business applications, so I know a lot of cases where clients came to us, like to the department, asked to create something, like, I don't know, maybe I read over a hundred of cases, and only several of them were related to image generation, but some of them, like more of these cases are related to audio, and one of the usual like request is, okay guys, we have 5,000 hours of recordings of, I don't know, meetings or customers calling us for the support, so we need to understand this data, right? So imagine you have a first-line support, like people calling, like real users calling, describing the issue, and the operators are just sharing, so what should you do to solve it? And you need to control it somehow, right? So you need to see what are the most popular questions, so what are the answers, so is the client is happy or not, right? And for this case, you need to voice processing, and processing the voice is actually very old technology. I don't remember how old it is, but like two things here usually working is text-to-speech and speech-to-text, and if we check, I don't know, like let's check Azure text-to-speech. Okay, it's AI speech now, all right, I got it. Everything is AI now. Let me check the pricing actually, DTS pricing. It's super cheap, it's super cheap. Okay, I think here. So this is, okay, free tier, all right. Basically, all right, they need this one. So speech-to-text, so in order to transcript something, like if you have a phone call, real-time transcription, $1 per hour, that's too much. Okay, batch transcription, so if I have a lot of audio calls, I don't know, like 100, I can post them as a batch, and this will result in 80 cents per hour, so not too much actually. Yeah, as usually, like Microsoft has like very complicated, very complicated stuff for billing, so it's hard to understand how much you will spend. Yeah, and here is like the text-to-speech, so basically two directions, like from speech, you can extract text, and from text, you can generate speech, right? And this is like the standard voice. I think this standard voice become neural like during like last year, because previously, they had different, they had a different pricing. Like the standard voice is like this robotized voice you usually hear when you call a bank or something, and neural voice is like more pleasant, more realistically, more naturally told. So right now, I don't think, they should have some kind of like cheap voice, like this old cheap voice. Probably it's inside the Azure AI Studio, but the check is not expensive, right? So one million characters, it's like, it's a lot. $15 for business, it's like, well, not too much, I think. So, and in case we have 1,000 of like phone calls transcripted, so it will result as only like less than $200, so that's acceptable for that. And they definitely use machine learning there, right? So because there's no way programmatically, like algorithmically to transcribe the speech. But still, the interesting thing here is, it's also possible to use machine learning techniques and all this concept of token we've been discussing previously, right, in working with speech in understanding the speech. And the project I would like to show you, this Whisper, so let me find, it should be here in the notes I put. Yeah, this one. It was introduced very similar once the chat GPT arrived, right, so,
